# About the PrestaShop open source project's Slack

## Joining the PrestaShop open source project's Slack

A chat has always been a good way to communicate around an open source project. In the past, IRC would have been the default choice. But nowadays, in the PrestaShop ecosystem, folks really like Slack, so, that's why it has been chosen.

This communication channel is open to anyone who wants to help and contribute to the PrestaShop open source project. There's many ways to contribute:

- Using
- Planning, sponsorising, or speaking at events (meetups, conferences, …)
- Design (specifications, UX/UI, …)
- Writings (documentation, blog posts, tutorials, video, …)
- Gardening (sorting issues, moderating the forum, …)
- Helping
- Reporting bugs
- Code (require skills)

The objective is to grow the ecosystem around the software, and of course, to improve the software itself.
