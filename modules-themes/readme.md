# List of third party, open source and free of charge modules and themes for the PrestaShop e-commerce solution

There are plenty of useful themes and modules available on the web from third party developers for the PrestaShop e-commerce solution. Unfortunately, there is no place currently to list them so people can find them.

So, let's build a knowledge base. If you want to contribute to this page, please create a pull request with your modules and themes, following the example:

### Module/theme name
- Description: (one or two lines max)
- Keywords: (topics, features, separated by a comma)
- Source code: (like a GitHub repository link for support, issues, and source code)
- Download link: (where to find a ready to use zip file: direct link, or link to the release page of your repository, or to a page on your website where people can download the zip file)

The aim is to use this data as a base to create content for a dedicated website in the future. That's why respecting the template is very important, so it can be processed by a script.
