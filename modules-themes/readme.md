# Listing third party open source and free of charge modules and themes for the PrestaShop e-commerce solution

There are plenty of useful themes and modules available on the web from third party developers for the PrestaShop e-commerce solution. Unfortunately, there is no place currently to list them so people can find them.

So, let's build a knowledge base. If you want to contribute to this page, please create a pull request with your modules and themes, following the example:

**Module/theme name**
* short description (one or two lines max)
* repository URL (like a GitHub repository link)
* download page link
* keywords, topics, features, separated by a comma

This will also be used as a base to create content for a dedicated website in the future.
