# PrestaShop Project's Office Hours

The Office Hours initiative is about project members making themselves available to the community (almost) every Tuesday at [11 am (Paris time)](https://time.is/1100_in_Paris), to discuss ongoing projects, pull requests, architectural decisions, etc. This is also a chance to answer some community questions and help them finish their contributions.

## Join the next meeting!

Would you like to discuss a pull request you are working on? Or the future of the project? Do you just want to listen to the discussion? If so, joining the meeting will be a great idea.

Office Hours are held on [this Google Meet room](https://meet.google.com/fer-hcgk-wti) every Tuesday at [11 am (Paris time)](https://time.is/1100_in_Paris), except for bank holiday days in most European countries.

If you want to suggest topics for discussion, please consider [filling out this form](https://forms.gle/2r7jPp5WxhFSUQme8).
