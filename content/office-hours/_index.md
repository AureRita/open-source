# PrestaShop Project's Office hours

The Office Hours initiative is about project members making themselves available to you, to the community, (almost) every Tuesday at 11 AM CET, to discuss everything related to the project.

These meetings have already proven it was a great idea. There have been constructive discussions about many ongoing projects, Pull Requests, architectural decisions, etc. This is also a chance to answer some community questions and help them finish their contributions.

## Join the next meeting!

Would you like to discuss a Pull Request you are working on? Or the future of the project? Do you just want to listen to the discussion? If so, joining the meeting will be a great idea.

Feel free to join on [this Google Meet link](https://meet.google.com/fer-hcgk-wti). Remember that Office Hours are held every Tuesday (except days that are bank holidays in most European countries) from 11:00 AM to 12 PM CET.

If you want to suggest topics for discussion, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/2r7jPp5WxhFSUQme8) (it is not required, though!).
