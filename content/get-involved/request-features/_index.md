# How to use GitHub to suggest a feature

PrestaShop uses GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. This is the best place to suggest ideas to improve the software.

## Creating a feature request

To create a feature request, go to the [list of issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues) and click on the "New issue" button on the right. Or just [click here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose).

On the next screen, choose "Feature request", and click on "Get started"

<img src="img/github-select-issue-type.png" alt="Choose Bug report" class="mx-lg-4" style="max-width: 700px">

Now fill out the form and click the "Submit new issue" button when you are done.

{{% notice tip %}}
GitHub provides very good documentation about how to write [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) with its [flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). It is possible to [highlight code syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/), [add pictures](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or even to [link issues and pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/).
