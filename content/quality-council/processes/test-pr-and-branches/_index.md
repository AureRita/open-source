# How to test Pull Requests

Tests determine the quality of a software. This process involves evaluating that a change works as intended, but above all, that it doesn't provide any unintended side effects.

To make testing easier, we provide a [Vagrant configuration]({{< relref "vagrant.md" >}}) designed for testing branches and pull requests.
