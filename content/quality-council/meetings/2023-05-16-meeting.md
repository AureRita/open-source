## Report

Like Pablo Borowicz said, each council can organize like it wants. So this is the goal of this meeting : define rules for the Quality Council.

### Members of the council

There are 3 profiles which are members of the Quality Council:
* Issue Manager
* Software Developer in Test
* Software Tester

Each member can be: 
* either a maintainer (can participate and vote during the Quality Council),
* or a committer (can participate during the Quality Council).

Members are updated on the [organization project page]({{< relref "/project-organization/people-and-roles#quality-council" >}}) with their role.

### Votes

* Only maintainers can vote
* Each maintainer has one vote
* Results of the vote are public
* Vote is accepted when a simple majority is reached

### Lead Council

* Actual Lead is [@Robin-Fischer-PS](https://github.com/Robin-Fischer-PS)
* He is elected for one year (until 1st of April 2024) by maintainers.

### Next Steps

We need to work on each profile (describe the job and how to be one of).
